This is a basic emulator for the classic etch-a-sketch toy. This project is based on the requirements for The Odin Project. 

TOP specifies for user input via mouseover, but I do not think that is in the spirit of the classic toy.

Instead, this basic project utilizes the arrow keys to create the sketch.
